Roleplaying Voice aims to be the go to plugin for most things related to player sound and expression!

Features:
AI voicelines for anything you type via Elevenlabs (after providing your own API key).
Expanded voice packs and possible sound additions that cover just about every character action imaginable with near infinite flexibility
Automatic twitch playback allows you to hear your favourite DJ's while inside venues without having to think or manually open a web browser. Everything is in the game world!
Penumbra support so that you can still sort your Roleplaying Voice sound mods.
Partial Mare support (sound is synced via a different service).
