Roleplaying Voice aims to be the go to plugin for most things related to player sound and expression!

Features:
- AI voicelines for anything you type via Elevenlabs (after providing your own API key).
- Expanded voice packs and possible sound additions that cover just about every character action imaginable with near infinite flexibility
- Automatic twitch playback allows you to hear your favourite DJ's while inside venues without having to think or manually open a web browser. Everything is in the game world!
- Penumbra support so that you can still sort your Roleplaying Voice sound mods.
- Partial Mare support (sound is synced via a different service).
