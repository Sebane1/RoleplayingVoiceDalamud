Artemis Roleplaying Kit aims to be the go to plugin for most things related to sound, and roleplaying quality of life!

Features:
- Crowdsourced NPC Dialogue that aims to provide voiceover for all unvoiced text in the MSQ, and side content.
- Generative voicelines for anything you type via Elevenlabs (after providing your own API key).
- Expanded voice packs and possible sound additions that cover just about every character action imaginable with near infinite flexibility
- Automatic twitch playback allows you to hear your favourite DJ's while inside venues without having to think or manually open a web browser. Everything is in the game world!
- Penumbra support so that you can still sort your Artemis Roleplaying Kit sound mods.
- Sync your custom voices and sounds with friends by whitelisting them in Artemis Rolplaying Kit!
- Dynamic character emote triggering based on text in custom emotes.
- Automated mod switching for animation mods. Just enter the mod name you want to trigger.
